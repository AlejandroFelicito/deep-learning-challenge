Module 21 Challenge 


## Description 
**deep-learning-challenge** solution, due 2/27/2024


## Before you begin 
1. Create a new repository for this project called **deep-learning-challenge**. Do not add this Challenge to an existing repository.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for the Deep Learning Challenge.
4. Push the above changes to GitHub.


## Requirements 

### Preprocess the Data (30 points)
- [X] Create a dataframe containing the `charity_data.csv` data , and identify the target and feature variables in the dataset (2 points)
- [X] Drop the `EIN` and `NAME` columns (2 points)
- [X] Determine the number of unique values in each column (2 points)
- [X] For columns with more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value (4 points)
- [X] Create a new value called Other that contains rare categorical variables (5 points)
- [X] Create a feature array, _X_, and a target array, _y_ by using the preprocessed data (5 points)
- [X] Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets (5 points)
- [X] Scale the data by using a StandardScaler that has been fitted to the training data (5 points)

### Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model (20 points)
- [X] Create a neural network model with a defined number of input features and nodes for each layer (4 points)
- [X] Create hidden layers and an output layer with appropriate activation functions (4 points)
- [X] Check the structure of the model (2 points)
- [X] Compile and train the model (4 points)
- [X] Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy (4 points)
- [X] Export your results to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity.h5 (2 points)

### Optimize the Model (20 points)
- [X] Repeat the preprocessing steps in a new Jupyter notebook (4 points)
- [X] Create a new neural network model, implementing at least 3 model optimization methods (15 points)
- [X] Save and export your results to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 (1 point)

### Write a Report on the Neural Network Model (30 points)
- [X] Write an analysis that includes a title and multiple sections, labeled with headers and subheaders (4 points)
- [] Format images in the report so that they display correction (2)
- [X] Explain the purpose of the analysis (4)
- [X] Answer all 6 questions in the results section (10)
- [X] Summarize the overall results of your model (4)
- [X] Describe how you could use a different model to solve the same problem, and explain why you would use that model (6)
